A cookie is a small piece of text that our web server stores on your computer or mobile device, which your browser sends to us when you return to our site. Cookies do not necessarily identify you if you are merely visiting our website; however, a cookie may store a unique identifier for each logged in user. The cookies we use are essential for the operation of the website, or are used for performance, functionality and security purposes.
</p>
<p className="my-4">
For example, cookies allow us to remember things about your visit to our website, such as your preferred language, time zone and other preferences in order to make the site and service easier for you to use.
</p>
<p className="my-4">
In order to offer the highest level of usability, performance and security we use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie consists of a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, which will be stored by the browser and will remain valid until its set expiration date (unless deleted by the user before the expiration date). A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
