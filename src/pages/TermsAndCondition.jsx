</p>
<p className="my-4">
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Services are provided "as is" and "as available" without any express or implied warranty or condition of any kind including, but not limited to, warranties or conditions of merchantable quality, merchantability, durability, noninfringement of Intellectual Property Rights, fitness for any particular purpose, that stored documents will be preserved without loss or that the Services will be uninterrupted, timely, or error-free, or that defects will be corrected. While arithmo attempts to ensure your access and use of the Services is safe, arithmo cannot and does not represent or warrant that the Services or its server(s) are free of viruses or other harmful components. Certain jurisdictions do not permit the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you. For example, these disclaimers do not override the legal protections (including any statutory warranties) that are granted to consumers by the laws of the EU.
</p>
<p className="my-4">
arithmo does not exclude or limit its liability to you where it would be illegal to do so—this includes any liability for arithmo’s fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation in providing the Services. In countries where the exclusions below are not allowed, we are responsible to you only for damages that are a reasonably foreseeable result of our failure to use reasonable care or our breach of the Terms. This paragraph does not affect consumer rights that cannot be waived or limited by any contract.
</p>
<p className="my-4">
In countries where exclusions or limitations of liability are allowed, in no event shall arithmo or its officers, directors, employees, contractors, suppliers, and agents ("arithmo parties"), be liable for any damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, for any direct, special, indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive or exemplary damages, or any other damages of any kind, including but not limited to, loss of use, loss of profits, business interruption, or loss of information), arising out of the use of, inability to use or reliance upon the Services, even if arithmo has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
</p>
<p className="my-4">
Independent of, severable from and to be enforced independently of any other enforceable or unenforceable provision of the Terms, in no event will arithmo parties be liable to you (including liability to person or persons whose claim or claims are based on or derived from a right or rights claimed by you), with respect to any and all claims at any and all times arising from or related to the use of the Services or the Terms, that exceeds the amount you have paid for the use of the Services during the previous 12 month period, or USD $10.00, whichever is greater. This provision does not apply to EU consumers where prohibited by applicable law.
</p>
<p className="my-4">
The foregoing limitations of liability and exclusion of certain damages will apply to all causes of action, regardless of the cause of action and whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, to the extent permitted by applicable law and regardless of the success or effectiveness of other remedies.

</p>
<p className="my-4"style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>
5.	MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION
</p>
<p className="my-4">
To the extent permitted under applicable law, arithmo reserves the right to discontinue offering all or part of the Services or to modify the Services at any time, without any liability to you or anyone else, in its sole discretion. For changes to paid offerings that, in arithmo’s reasonable discretion, result in a material diminishment of value to you, we will make reasonable commercial efforts to notify you of such modification or discontinuation. If you are dissatisfied with any aspect of the Services at any time, your sole and exclusive remedy is to cease using the Services. arithmo, in its sole and exclusive discretion, may suspend or terminate your access to the Services if: (a) you violate the Terms either in letter or in spirit; (b) If you fail to make timely payments of fees for the Services; (c) if we are required to do so by law (for example, if providing software to a specific region becomes unlawful); and (d) if we choose to discontinue the Services, in whole or in part (such as if it becomes impractical for us to provide Services in your jurisdiction). If you are a user of a free account, arithmo may terminate the Services with or without cause upon 30 days’ notice to you. Upon termination of the Services, your right to use the Services immediately ceases. If we discontinue any Services in its entirety, then we will provide you with a pro rata refund for any unused fees for the discontinued Services that you may have prepaid. Termination of your account shall not relieve you of any obligation or liability accruing prior to such termination, nor preclude arithmo from pursuing all rights and remedies it may have under these Terms, at law or in equity, with respect to breach of these Terms.

<p className="my-4"style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>
6.	CHANGES TO TERMS
</p>

8.	GOVERNING LAW
</p>
<p className="my-4">
These General Terms and Conditions shall be subject to Germanyn law with no recourse to its conflict of law rules and the Rome I Regulation. In the event of any legal claims arising from either party, the competent court in Hamburg, Germany shall have the exclusive jurisdiction. In case the user is a consumer, special consumer protection provisions of the law of the country in which the consumer has their habitual residence take precedence over Germanyn law. Therefore, if the user is a consumer within the meaning of Art. 6 Rome I Regulation, the consumer also enjoys the protection of the mandatory provisions of the law that would be applicable without this choice of law clause pursuant to Art. 6 (2) Rome I Regulation. Further if the user is a consumer, lawsuits against arithmo.ai can be filed not only at the exclusive place of jurisdiction but also at the court in the country in which the user has their residence. The user as a consumer can only be sued at the court with jurisdiction over the subject matter and location of their place of residence.
